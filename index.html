            What personal information do we collect from the users of our app?
        </h2>
        <p>
            When using our app in locked mode, the state of your phone is monitored(Ringing, Talking or Idle). This monitoring is used
            to determine when to temporarily lift the lock mode so an incoming call can be taken. We do not record any information
            about your calls.
        </p>
        <h2>When do we collect information?</h2>
        <p>
            As explained above no personally identifiable information is collected, we just use an Android Permission to monitor the
            call state of your phone(for example but not limited to: Ringing, Talking or Idle).
        </p>
        <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
        <p>
            As explained above the call state of your phone is only used to decide if the lock mode in the app should be temporarily
            disabled.
        </p>
